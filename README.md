This is mostly a toy project to experiment with Scala Native's multi threading.

## Running

You can run the JVM version with `cs launch eu.joaocosta:rokrok_3:latest.release`

For the Native version, you currently need to build from source, which requires SDL2.

You can run it with `just run-native`.
