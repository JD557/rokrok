This is mostly a toy project to experiment with Scala Native's multi threading.

## Running

You can run the JVM version with `cs launch eu.joaocosta:rokrok_3:latest.release`

For the Native version, you can either download the [latest precompiled release](https://github.com/JD557/rokrok/releases) or build it source, which requires SDL2.
You can run it with `just run-native`.
